## Lab 2

### App Description
In this lab we'll continue improving our Flashcards app by adding new features on top of everything you built in the previous lab. We'll create a new screen where users can create new flashcards right from the app. Whenever you want to study something new you can just create a new flashcard!

While building this you will learn how to create completely new screens, how to present them from your main screen, and how to pass data from one screen to another. By the end of this lab your Flashcard app should be able to let users create their own flashcard.
